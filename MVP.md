To exploring this goal, I used **BarChart** to show the age ranges for the total number of clients there are loan disbursed in 2020, considering there are 3 types of financing.
The business funding bar is plotted in green, Individuals funding bar is plotted in blue and transport funding bar is plotted in orange.The result shows individual funding is the most demanded according to ages (below 30 years old,30-40 years old, 40-60 years old and over 60 years old).Then business funding (below 30 years old,30-40 years old, 40-60 years old).Then transport funding (below 30 years old,30-40 years old, 40-60 years old).
