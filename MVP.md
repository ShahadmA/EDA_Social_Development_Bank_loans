### The goal of this project is understand clients behavior during 2020 .



![Funding type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/93095814/142738160-784f7934-02a6-4714-96b9-829e120c60e6.png)




To exploring this goal, I used a **BarChart** to show the age ranges for the total number of clients there are loan disbursed in 2020, considering there are 3 types of funding.
The business funding bar has plotted with green, the Individuals funding bar has plotted with blue, and the transport funding bar has plotted with orange.The result shows individuals funding is the most demanded according to ages (below 30 years old,30-40 years old, 40-60 years old, and over 60 years old). Then business funding (below 30 years old,30-40 years old, 40-60 years old). Then transport funding (below 30 years old,30-40 years old, 40-60 years old).
